How to add a new Mob Spawner type.

** A Mob Spawner is a part of Mob Spawning System. Which in turn is comprised of many
Mob Spawners. Each Mob Spawner has a Unique algorithm for spawning Mobs. The System's role
is to controll the timing of when each Mob Spawner starts spawning. **

1) Locate Folder _Scenes/Battlegrounds/_Scripts/Spawners/Spawners

2) Create a new Script

3) Inherit from MobSpawner

4) Override StartSpawningCycle() and StopSpawningCycle(), They will be called acordingly
to the time and duration floats set on the scripts.

5) StopSpawningCycle() must call base if overriden!

5) To use the Mob Spawner - Place the MobSpawner script as a Component on a Scene Object 
under the "Mob Spawner" Object under "Battleground Controller" Object.
