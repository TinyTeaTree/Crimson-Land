1) Locate the Save File under globals and create a new GameObject

2) Locate the SaveFragment script folder and add a new Script to it,
this shall be your fragment

3) Inherit from SaveFragment

4) Implement abstract class

6) Create a [System.Serializable] data structure that will hold all the 
members that need to be saved.

7) send the data structure as a return to Serialize()

8) in the Deserialize() cast the graph to the data structure and assign it
instead of your empty one.

9) Implement the Reset() function, it is supposed to clean up the fragment to the state that
it belongs to noone and is ready to be deserialized. Call the base.Reset() in order to clean all controll data as well.

11) make sure that whenever a change to the data is made, that the newInfoPresent flag is
set to true


12) The name of the gameobject of the save fragment on which it is component of,
is the name of the file. make sure no duplicates.
