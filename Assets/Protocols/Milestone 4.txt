*** Milestone 4 ***

** In this milestone we want to turn our battle ground into a winnable scene that provides completion status. And in that way we can create a sequence of battlegrounds that progress when you complete them. For that the user system needs to change in order to support multiple users and their progresses. Users will no longer be destroyed when they die, they will simply fail the current battleground and have their economy effected. The battlegrounds will drop goods and also reward for completion and achievments. The rewards will be used to level up and purchase items in the shop. The game will also have survival mode that never ends, When you die or quit you will go to the game over high score page, the survival mode will use the weapons and levels of your character **
