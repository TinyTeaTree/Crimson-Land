We want to reach a state where we have a playable game up and running.
	For that we need to construct a basic battlground with a locomotion driver
	and basic enemy AI.and player avatar with properties (health and speed).
	In this first milestone we will be plaing and shooting mobs untill we get
	flocked and die.
