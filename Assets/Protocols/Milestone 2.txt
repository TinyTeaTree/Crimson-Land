We want to enhance the genericness of the properties that make up the battlground.
The Gun and Mob type need to be interchable and configurable as easy as drag and
drop. And the AI of the mobs also.

Also we want to start developing and Persistant saving and
for the game. For that we want to already implement the score
parameter which will be used for the highscore which will be provided by the 
storage and thats it for now.

Give Mobs the ability to attack the avatar.

Give bullets max traveresed distance parameter.

Make three different mob types.

Make the Mob spawner be able to spawn them.

Make three different movement algorithms for mobs, have the movement as easily
interchanged as changing component types.

Make Three gun types.

Make the changing of guns as simple as Instantiating the gun.

Make three different battlegrounds and have the battlegrounds be easily 
interchanged.

Make a persistant saving module that will let us have the ability to load the
high score
